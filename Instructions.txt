Data Regarding COVID-19:

	Follow Instructions as shown on terminal.

Date format will be: mm-dd-yyyy

In data, if null, or an empty string, or N/A or negative value is given, then an error message is generated. (rather than displaying those values or computing using those values)

In range query fields, the date is asked, and in that start should be strictly less than the end date, otherwise, an error is generated.

A smoothing factor of 0.0001 is used for the computation of change in percentage kinds of queries.

Log File will be generated with the name '21CS60R53_log_file.txt'
(First Line of the log file is blank, entries began from 2nd line)
(Output will be stored in log file only if all the inputs are correct)
(End the code properly, then only this file is over-written correctly)

	In this file, all the output shown on terminal is stored in this too.

	Format of log file:

	For World:
	<Place>	<field_requested>	<field_value>
	(if field value is not defined, then error will be shown, in place of field value)

	For Continent:
	<Place>	<field_requested>	<field_value>	<percent_of_total_world_cases>
	(if field value is not defined, then error will be shown, in place of field value and percent of total world cases)

	For Country:
	(Normal Queries 0 to 9)
	<Place>	<field_requested>	<field_value>	<percent_of_total_world_cases>
	(if field value is not defined, then error will be shown, in place of field value and percent of total world cases)

	(For Range Queries 10 to 13)
	<Place>	<field_requested>	<Start_Date>	<End_Date>	<field_value>	<country_having_closest_field_value>
	(if field value is not defined, then error will be shown, in place of field value and country_having_closest_field_value)
	(if file don't have data of that field, then Dates input is not asked, and error will be shown, in place of start date, end date, field value and country_having_closest_field_value
